Disease subtype discovery plays a crucial role in personalized medicine, aiming to identify homogeneous patient cohorts with similar clinical and molecular profiles, which can lead to enhancement in prognostic predictions and optimized treatment strategies for each patientâ€™s unique profile. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of different clustering approaches for disease subtype discovery, leveraging multi-omics data integration techniques. The dataset used comprised molecular data from diverse omics sources, including mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression data. We present the clustering results and compare them with known disease subtypes in the literature to evaluate the performance of the methods. In short, our findings indicate that leveraging PAM and Spectral clustering methods, coupled with the integration of multi-omics data using the integrated matrix by SNF, yielded the highest performance compared to other techniques investigated.
