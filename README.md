# Disease Subtype Discovery using Multi-Omics Data Integration

Throughout this project, we explore methodologies for uncovering molecular disease subtypes using multi-omics data. The primary goal is to identify cohesive patient groups based on similar clinical and/or molecular characteristics. This facilitates improved prognostic predictions and personalized treatment strategies, aligning with the principles of personalized (precision) medicine.
